Some people think that IT IS PREFERABLE FOR young people TO choose different TYPE OF job THAN THEIR PARENTS DID.-from their parents jobs.-  
However, in my opinion, young people -can- have more advantages -when-IF they work in THE same FIELD AS -boundaries of- their parents SINCE  
-This is because -they can GET HELPFUL -have given useful- advices from their parents and THEY CAN UTILIZE -use relation from- their parent's PROFESSIONAL CONTACTS.-occupations.-  
<br/>
To begin with, when young WORKERS CAN RECEIVE -laborer have same jobs with their parents, they can have- useful advices from their parents WHEN THEY SHARE THE SAME CAREER.  
Parents HAVE GAINED A LOT OF -had many- knowledge ABOUT THEIR JOBS DUE TO EXTENSIVE -from their wide -work experiences, AND THUS THEY CAN PROVIDE VALUABLE DIRECTION. -so they can guide sound way.-  
For example, my friend becAme aN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL teacher like her parents.  
When she BEGAN TEACHING-start to teach-, THINGS WERE REALLY OVERWHELMING -she has trouble with controling situations- at first.  
She had a hard time to MANAGING-master-HER students' behavior, and had SHE WAS NOT SURE OF -no convince that what she done is-THE best way TO SOLVE THE -of solving- problem.  
However, her parents WERE ABLE TO -can- give HER A LOT OF -many- useful TIPS ON HOW TO -ways to- manage HER-their- students.  
They SUGGESTED THAT SHE SET CLEAR RULES AND ENFORCE THEM-supposed her to make a exact rule and apply it -consistently, and she IMPLEMENTED HER PARENTS' ADVICE -did it -right away.  
Consequently, her students' behavior dramatically improved.  
<br/>
On top of that, young people can MAKE use OF THEIR PARENTS' PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIONS -working relationship- when they work in THE same field- with their parents.-  
IN PARTICULAR, -Especially,- young workers can utilize THEIR PARENTS' WORK-RELATED CONTACTS TO CREATE USEFUL BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS. -connections related to their parents job to make useful corporational collaboration relations.-  
TAKE -Let's see- the example of Bill Gates who CHOSE A CARRER IN BUSINESS -have chosen a job in business field- like his mother.  
HIs first NOTEWORTHY SUCCESS WAS WHEN -marked achievment is that- IBM hired HIS COMPANY, Microsoft, TO DEVELOP- for developing- software FOR IBM'S COMPUTERS. -which is used for their computers.-  
This -event- happend because Bill Gate's mother haD PROFESSIONAL CONNECTION -occupational relationship- with ONE OF IBM's DIRECTOR -chairman.-  
She TOLD-talk- THE IBM BOARD MEMBER-to chairman of IBM- about Microsoft, AND as a result, Bill gates' company COULD develop A PARTNERSHIP WITH IBM -collaboration relations with IBM.-  
<br/>
To sum up, young people who PURSUE THE SAME CAREER THAT -work- same field with- their parents DID can GET INVALUABLE GUIDANCE FROM THEIR PARENTS AND -have very valuable directions and have- benefits from their parents' WORK RELATED CONTACTS. -occupational relations.-  
In this regards, I argue that IT IS ADVISABLE FOR young people -should- TO follow IN their parents' CAREER FOOTSTEPS -job- rather than SELECT A DIFFERENT OCCUPATION FOR TEHMSELVES. -choose another jobs.-

The lecturer argues that ATTRACTING NEW BUSINESS WITH INCENTIVES CAN HAVE DRAWBACKS. -luring new companies by incentives has drawbacks.-  
This contradicts THE reading passage's claim that LURING NEW BUSINESS WITH INCENTIVES IS A GREATE IDEA -tempting new corporations by inducement is a good idea.-  
<br/>
First, the lecturer maintains that IT DOESN'T ADD MONEY FOR LOCAL INVESTMENT-incentives do not add local money for investment.-  
A UNIVERSITY -In one university's study- found THAT OVERALL-total- tax revenue WAS REDUCED. -decreased.-  
Companies RECEIVE TAX -gave- rebateS as incentives, SO tax revenue dOES not increas.  
This casts doubt on the reading passage's claim that ATTRACTING -luring- new BUSINESS WITH INCENTIVES-companies- GENERATE-make- more TAX revenue for local investment.  
<br/>
Next, the lecturer asserts that it doES not provide more JOBS -work- for local people.  
THE New BUSINESSES -corporations- WILL compete with existing ONES -companies-, WHICH -this- means that some existing jobs WILL BE LOST -could be isappear.-  
In addition, THE new companies WILL probably BRING -relocate- their OWN employees to THE new AREA -region-, SO local RESIDENTS -citizens- WILL NOT -cannot- get THE new job.  
This counters the reading passage's claim that GIVING INCENTIVES TO -new- companies WILL CREATE JOBS FOR LOCALS. -make a lot of new jobs.-  
<br/>
Finally, the lecturers argues that IT DOESN'T HELP TO LOCAL ENVIRONMENT. -green incentives did not reduce pollution.-  
IN FACT, POLLUTION WILL INCREASE LOCALLY WHEN ANY NEW BUSINESS IS ADDED TO A REGION -Incentive for green factory is useless.-  
THIS IS BECAUSE EVEN A Green factory -even- generate A small AMOUNT OF pollutions.  
This refutes the reading passage's claim that USING -green- incentive TO ATTRACT NEW BUSINESS WILL BENEFIT THE LOCAL -is good for-environment.
