history - both countable and uncountable   
As an uncountable noun, history is the study of or a record of past events considered together, especially events of a particular period, country, or. 
EXAMPLES:

The last lecture was about American history.  
As a countable noun, the word history is often treated as a singular noun. In this case, it is something that has been done or experienced by a particular person or thing many times over a long period:  
EXAMPLES:  
Our family has a history of diabetes.  
There’s a long history of industrial disputes at the factory.  
- the history of America  
- the history of Rome  
[using “the” before the noun pertains to the specific history of a place]  
In some cases, the plural form “histories” is used to pertain of different kinds of history through time and even about a drama based on historical events:  
EXAMPLE:   
Histories and accounts of travels have been composed both in Arabic and Chinese.  
the histories of Shakespeare

Tip:  
1. Definition: ”non-renewable resource (also called a finite resource)“ is a natural resource that cannot be readily replaced by natural means at a pace quick enough to keep up with consumption.  



2. generalizing   

When generalizing countable nouns, you can either:  
1. make the noun plural:  
Cats are gentle pets.  
People like to interact with others.
OR  
2. make it singular but add an article:
The cat is a gentle pet.  
A person likes to interact with another person.  


3. Which - When the clause contains unimportant or additional information, it can be set off with commas. If you remove a clause with which from a sentence, the meaning does not change significantly.  

(CORRECT) There was an earthquake in Japan, which is bad news.   
Let us try removing the “which” clause: 
(STILL CORRECT) There was an earthquake in Japan.   
(CORRECT) Our office, which has two conference rooms, is located in Toronto.  
Let us try removing the “which” clause:
(STILL CORRECT) Our office is located in Toronto.  



4. Compound Subjects  
If two or more singular or plural subjects are joined by AND, it will act as a plural compound subject and will need a plural verb.   

Example: My brother and I are hungry.   


5. To vs For   
Use ”to“ in these cases:  
1. Destination - We’re going to Paris.  
2. Time - It‘s quarter to 2.  
3. Distance - It’s about 10 miles from my house to university.  
4. Comparing - I prefer sleeping to working.  
5. Giving - I gave the book to my sister.  
6. Motive/Reason (with verb) - I came here to see you.  


Use ”for“ in these cases:  
1. Benefits - Yogurt is good for your digestion.  
2. Period of time - We have lived here for two years.  
3. Schedule - I made an appointment for May 3.  
4. Agree with - Are you for or against the development of nuclear weapons?  
5. Doing something to help someone - Could you carry these books for me?  
6. Motive/Reason (with noun) - Let‘s go out for a drink.  
7. Function (with a verb-ing form) - A ladle is a big spoon used for serving soup.  


6. Uncountable nouns  
Do not use articles when generalizing uncountable nouns and plural countable nouns.  
Examples:  
		Honesty is a great trait.   (Uncountable)  
		Water is an important resource. (Uncountable)  
		Fruits are good for you. (Plural countable)  

Noncount Nouns (Uncountable Nouns)  
Some nouns have only a singular form;   you cannot add a number before or an “s” to the end of these words. This group of nouns is called noncount.  
Examples of nouncount words:   information, content, knowledge, technology, society, equipment, news, fish, public transportation, medicine, work, architecture, pollution
