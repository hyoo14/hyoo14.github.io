I prefer to attend a university in a big city to one in a small town.  

First, a big city can give me a more exciting life.  
To be specific, there are a lot of off-campus activities that students can enjoy.  
(Students have access to numerous theaters, cafes, and mails where they can relax and have a good time)  

Second, a big-city university can provide me with more opportunities.  
For example, in big cities students have more chances to meet people from various countries and backgrounds,  
(and this kind of social networking can make it easy for students to experience different cultures.)  



I agree with the statement that schools should require all students to take a physical education class.   

First, physical education provides health benefits and makes students stronger.    
For example, gym classes require students to stretch and exercise, and these activities help students take better care of their bodies.  

Second, P.E. classes are fun.  
To be specific, playing sports can be pleasurable for students, and having fun offers stress relief and a break from the mental pressure of academic classes.  



I prefer to communicate face-to-face rather than through e-mail  

First, being face-to-face promotes clear communication.  
For example, facial expressions and body language convey a lot of important information, so face-to-face communication is clearer than written form.  

Second, talking to someone directly is more convenient.  
To be specific, you can get an immediate response with no delay.  
(and this has a significant advantage over e-mail)  



I think building a park is better than building a library in my community.    


First, people will be able to do more activities at a park than in a library.  
For example, people can go for walks, play sports, or have picnics with friends or family at a park.  

Second, building a park is better for our health.  
To be specific, there will be a lot of trees in the park, and they can provide us with fresh air.  



I prefer deciding after taking time to think things over to making decisions instantly.    

First, the decisions we make often affect the rest of our lives.  
For example, things such as marriage and purchasing a house are long-term commitments, so they require careful thought.  

Second, making hasty decisions can lead to mistakes.  
For example, once I bought clothes hastily without thinking and later regretted it because I didn't have enough money to buy my textbooks for school.

I agree with the statement that young people these days are better informed about world events than the young people of the past.  

First, technology has given young people more exposure to world events.  
For example, technology such as smartphones and the Internet has made it possible for people to access news around the world almost instantaneously.  

Second, travel to most parts of the world is possible today.  
To be specific, being able to visit nearly any country on earth via air, water, or land has given young people the opportunity to learn about other countries firsthand.    



I would prefer to take a challenging course at a university.    

First, working hard gives me a sense of accomplishment.  
To be specific, if a course is easy, I would feel that I'm not really accomplishing anything.  
On the other hand, if the work is demanding, then I could gain a sense of self-worth and be proud of myself.  

Second, a challenging course can better prepare me for the future.  
To be specific, getting a good job is becoming difficult because there is so much competition.  
(If I am well trained, I will be able to compete better with others.)  



I think studying a small class is more effective for students than studying in a large one.  

First, students pay more attention to the lecture in a small class.  
For example, when I was in a large class, there were so many students that I was distracted and unable to focus on the lecture.  

Second, students have more opportunities to ask questions in small classes.  
To be specific, the teacher will have enough time to respond to each student's question if there are fewer students.    


I prefer to work someone who has a similar way of thinking to me.  

First, having common ideas will make it easier to cooperate.  
To be specific, it is much better to have a consensus in the workplace because if everyone is on the same page, it is possible to avoid awkward disagreements.  

Second, thinking the same way allows people to get things done faster.  
For example, agreeing on a particular goal and how to accomplish the goal means each person can focus on completing tasks as quickly as possible.  


I disagree with the statement that the government should force rich people to share their wealth with poor people by imposing higher taxes on them.  

First, imposing higher taxes on the rich is unfair.  
To be specific, it is unfair to make them pay higher taxes just because they are rich, since most of them earn their money by working hard.  

Second, there are many voluntary ways to help poor people.  
For example, rich people can help the poor by making donations or providing community services.  
These ways are much more beneficial than paying higher taxes.
