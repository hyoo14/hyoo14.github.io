The lecturer argues that we still do not know the origin of dogs.  
This contradicts the reading passage's claim that dog domestication can be explained.  


First, the lecturer contends that people would not have adopted wolves as hunting parners.  
Ancient people set traps and hid nearby, but wolves chase after their pray.  
This means that hunting with wolves would have been more difficult for people.  
Also, it would have been too challenging to teach wolves because they become more aggressive as they age.  
This casts doubt on the reading passage's claim that dogs descended from wolves that were trained by people.  


Next, the lecturer asserts that the domestication of dogs happened much earlier than 16,000 years ago.  
Footprints of a boy and a dog were recently found in a cave in France.  
An analysis showed that they are at least 26,000 years old.  
This counters the reading passage's claim that the domestication of dogs took place about 16,000 years ago.  


Finally, the lecturer claims that dogs were domesticated in more than one place, not only in China.  
The oldest dog fossils were found in Europe, North America, and the Middle East, in addition to China.  
Moreover, the DNA of dogs shows that they had four ancestors from different locations.  
This refutes the reading passage's claim that dogs spread around the world after being domesticated in China.
