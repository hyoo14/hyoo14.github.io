# target study  

<br/>

This course studies modern statistical machine learning with emphasis on Bayesian modeling and inference.

   
Covered topics include fundamentals of probabilities and decision theory, regression, classification, graphical models, mixture models, clustering, expectation maximization, hidden Markov models, Kalman filtering, and linear dynamical systems.

# topics extending  

* statistical machine learning -> Bayesian modeling and inference  
* fundamental probabilities and decision theory  
* regression  
* classification  
** decision trees and rule learning  
** naive bayes and bayesian networks  
** logistic regression / maximum entropy  
** neural networks(deep)  
** svm  
** nearest-neighbor / instance-based  
* graphical madels  
* mixture models  
* clustering  
* expectation maximization  
* hidden markove models  
** markov chain = first-order observable markov model  
*** current state only depends on previous state  
*** markov assumption: P(qi|q1 ... qi-1) = P(qi|qi-1)  
* kalman filtering  
* linear dynamical systems
