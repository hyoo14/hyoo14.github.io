I agree with the statement that cell phones should not be allowed in schools.   
First, cell phones can disturb classes.   
For example, if someone's phone rings, it could interrupt the teacher.  

Second, cell phones can be distracting.   
To be specific, students can be distracted by sending and receiving text messages. (This could also distract others nearby.)   

For these reason, I believe students shouldn't use their cell phones in school.

According to the reading, a theater professor has given his students an assignment to attend a play and write a review.   
The woman doesn't think it is a good ides for two reason.   

First, she says that the deadline is too soon.   
This is because the students are performing in a play next month and they are still practicing, so they don't have time to watch a play and write a review on top of that.  

Second, she mentions that the discount on tickets is too small.   
This is because they already spend money on books and supplies, so it's burdensome for the students to buy tickets.   

For these reasons, she thinks it is not a good idea.

According to the reading, the peak-end rule is how people judge and overall experience based on its peak and end.   
The professor uses a personal experience to explain the peak-end rule.  

First, she describes her stay at a five star hotel.   
She was welcomed and was impressed with everything. However, at the hotel restaurant, she was disappointed because the steak tasted horrible.  

Then, she describes how she called the front desk for assistance, but nobody answered. So she struggled down to the lobby to check out and waited for an hour. As a result, even though her first impression of the hotel were positive, she remembered the total experience as bad.   

These examples demonstrate the peak-end rule.

The professor explains how aquatic insects survive underwater by giving two examples.  

First, he describes physical gills, which extract oxygen from the water. He uses the example of a mayfly larva. It moves its gills back and forth to increase the oxygen it receives.   

Second, he describes high levels of hemoglobin.  
Hemoglobin is a substance in the blood that helps transport  oxygen to cells. He mentions the example of a bloodworm. It has high levels of hemoglobin, so it can store a backup supply of oxygen.  

These examples demonstrate how aquatic insects survive underwater.

According to the reading, a student wrote a letter to the school newspaper suggesting that the library change its policy on lending out art books.   
The man does not think it is a good idea for two reasons.   


First, he says that shortening the lending period is unrealistic. This is because students need more than one week to finish assignments. It takes a long time to read, take notes, and double-check things.   


Second, he mentions that leaving ID cards is not practical. This is because students need their cards for other purposes, such as for accessing study roms and dining halls.   


For these reasons, he believes it is not a great idea.

According to the reading, restoration ecology is the practice of actively restoring damaged ecosystems.  
The professor uses two examples to explain restoration ecology.  


First, he describes how cover crops are planted to prevent erosion.  
Quickly growing annual grasses fix themselves into the soil and prevent it from eroding.  
Cover crops also slow raindrops before they hit the ground and loosen the soil.  


Second, he describes how controlled prairie fires are used to restore native plants.  
The fires burn away dead plants and invasive species which compete with native plants for light and resources.  
The fires also darken the earth, so it absorbs more sunlight and helps plants grow.  


These examples demonstrate restoration ecology.

The professor describes the benefits of flooding to ancient farmers by giving two examples.  


First, she describes how flooding provided a water resource.  
In desert climates, people had to find ways to use floodwater to farm.  
For instance, Mesopotamian farmer built canals from the rivers, which bought water to their fields, and they made dams to store water.  


Second, she describes how flooding made the land rich.  
When rivers flood, mud containing nutrients washes into field and enriches the soil.  
For example, the soil of Egypt was poor in nutrients, but when the Nile flooded, rich mud was carried onto shore, and it made growing lots of crops possible.  


These examples demonstrate two ways flooding benefited ancient farmers.
