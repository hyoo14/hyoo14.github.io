I agree with the statement that cell phones should not be allowed in schools.   
First, cell phones can disturb classes.   
For example, if someone's phone rings, it could interrupt the teacher.  

Second, cell phones can be distracting.   
To be specific, students can be distracted by sending and receiving text messages. (This could also distract others nearby.)   

For these reason, I believe students shouldn't use their cell phones in school.

According to the reading, a theater professor has given his students an assignment to attend a play and write a review.   
The woman doesn't think it is a good ides for two reason.   

First, she says that the deadline is too soon.   
This is because the students are performing in a play next month and they are still practicing, so they don't have time to watch a play and write a review on top of that.  

Second, she mentions that the discount on tickets is too small.   
This is because they already spend money on books and supplies, so it's burdensome for the students to buy tickets.   

For these reasons, she thinks it is not a good idea.   

-------------------------------------------------

According to the reading, the peak-end rule is how people judge and overall experience based on its peak and end.   
The professor uses a personal experience to explain the peak-end rule.  

First, she describes her stay at a five star hotel.   
She was welcomed and was impressed with everything. However, at the hotel restaurant, she was disappointed because the steak tasted horrible.  

Then, she describes how she called the front desk for assistance, but nobody answered. So she struggled down to the lobby to check out and waited for an hour. As a result, even though her first impression of the hotel were positive, she remembered the total experience as bad.   

These examples demonstrate the peak-end rule.

The professor explains how aquatic insects survive underwater by giving two examples.  

First, he describes physical gills, which extract oxygen from the water. He uses the example of a mayfly larva. It moves its gills back and forth to increase the oxygen it receives.   

Second, he describes high levels of hemoglobin.  
Hemoglobin is a substance in the blood that helps transport  oxygen to cells. He mentions the example of a bloodworm. It has high levels of hemoglobin, so it can store a backup supply of oxygen.  

These examples demonstrate how aquatic insects survive underwater.

I agree with the statement that elementary school teachers should encourage their students to use computers.   


First, computers are good learning tools for students.   
To be specific, there are interesting materials available to learners these days.   
They can easily access these useful resources with computers.     


Second, the ability to use a computer is an essential life skill.   
For example, communications now frequently occur through computers.  
Consequently, students will need to use computers in school and work thrughout their lives.   


For these reasons, I think elementary school teachers should help students learn to use computers.

According to the reading, a student wrote a letter to the school newspaper suggesting that the library change its policy on lending out art books.   
The man does not think it is a good idea for two reasons.   


First, he says that shortening the lending period is unrealistic. This is because students need more than one week to finish assignments. It takes a long time to read, take notes, and double-check things.   


Second, he mentions that leaving ID cards is not practical. This is because students need their cards for other purposes, such as for accessing study roms and dining halls.   


For these reasons, he believes it is not a great idea.

According to the reading, restoration ecology is the practice of actively restoring damaged ecosystems.  
The professor uses two examples to explain restoration ecology.  


First, he describes how cover crops are planted to prevent erosion.  
Quickly growing annual grasses fix themselves into the soil and prevent it from eroding.  
Cover crops also slow raindrops before they hit the ground and loosen the soil.  


Second, he describes how controlled prairie fires are used to restore native plants.  
The fires burn away dead plants and invasive species which compete with native plants for light and resources.  
The fires also darken the earth, so it absorbs more sunlight and helps plants grow.  


These examples demonstrate restoration ecology.

The professor describes the benefits of flooding to ancient farmers by giving two examples.  


First, she describes how flooding provided a water resource.  
In desert climates, people had to find ways to use floodwater to farm.  
For instance, Mesopotamian farmer built canals from the rivers, which bought water to their fields, and they made dams to store water.  


Second, she describes how flooding made the land rich.  
When rivers flood, mud containing nutrients washes into field and enriches the soil.  
For example, the soil of Egypt was poor in nutrients, but when the Nile flooded, rich mud was carried onto shore, and it made growing lots of crops possible.  


These examples demonstrate two ways flooding benefited ancient farmers.

I believe that television has a negative influence on people.  


First of all, there are too many violent programs on televisions.  
Watching thousands of images of killing is not good for people.  
These increase people’s aggression and anger.  
The number of crimes in our society is related to all the violence that television feeds people.  


Moreover, television is mindless entertainment.  
Most programs do not serve any educational purpose and encourage passiveness.  
As a result, people become less active.  
Some would even argue they become unquestioning robots.  


-------------------------------------------------    


According to the reading, the university has changed the dormitory visitation policy, allowing visitors to stay in a resident’s room only until 11 p.m. on weekdays.  
The woman thinks it is a good idea for two reasons.  


First, she says that when visitors stay late, some residents find it difficult to get enough sleep.  
They can get only 5 hours sleep with the old policy, but 7 hours with the new policy.  


Second, she mentions that many visitors sleep over without permission when they stay late.  
This makes dorm residents feel uncomfortable and feel like their privacy is violated.

According to the reading, the halo effect is a cognitive bias wherein the evaluation of a specific attribute affects unrelated traits.  
The professor describes two examples to explain the halo effect.  


First, he describes the connection between beauty and perceived intelligence.  
In a study, participants were asked to read a paragraph and then shown different photos of the supposed author.  
Half of them were shown a photo of an attractive person and half were shown a photo of an unattractive person.  
When they were asked to rate the paragraph, the participants who were shown the more attractive photo gave higher scores.  


Second, he describes the connection between attractiveness and sentencing outcomes in criminal trials.  
Photos of defendants in the cases were rated on attractiveness, and then the ratings were compared with the outcomes of the cases.  
Attractive people received shorter sentences.

The professor explains how animals in the Arctic have evolved by giving two examples.  


First, she describes the reindeer, which has developed long legs.  
The animal’s long legs keep its body above the ground, which helps it maintain its temperature.  
In addition, the animal’s legs feature hooves with a sharp rim so they can slice through snow and dig into ice.  


Second, she describes the sea lion, which has a layer of fat called blubber underneath their skin.  
The blubber provides a barrier between the internal organs of the animal and the cold water.  
Moreover, the animal’s blood vessels don’t travel to the outer parts of its body, and this prevents heat loss.
