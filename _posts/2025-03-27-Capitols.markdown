## List of visit place  


* Massachusetts State Capitol (Boston)

<img src="https://github.com/hyoo14/hyoo14.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/capitols/boston_outside.jpg?raw=true"  width="100" />

It seems smaller than I expected. Massachusetts is historical and comparably big state with big city like Boston.  
It is actually located in Boston but, not that magnificiant as Boston.  
생각보다 작았다..   


* Rhode Island State Capitol (Providence)

<img src="https://github.com/hyoo14/hyoo14.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/capitols/providence_outside.jpg?raw=true"  width="100" />

It is bigger than I expected. It seems okay.  
생각보다 컸다.  


* Connecticut State Capitol (Hartford)

<img src="https://github.com/hyoo14/hyoo14.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/capitols/hartford_outside.jpg?raw=true"  width="100" />

It looks really beautiful outside.  
외관이 매우 아름다웠다.  

* New York State Capitol (Albany)

<img src="https://github.com/hyoo14/hyoo14.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/capitols/albany_outside.jpg?raw=true"  width="100" />

New York is New York even it is not the city but the state capitol.  
뉴욕은 역시 뉴욕  


* New Jersey State Capitol (Trenton)

<img src="https://github.com/hyoo14/hyoo14.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/capitols/trenton_outside.jpg?raw=true"  width="100" />

It seems better than I expected.  
It is a good complex with nice mixture of buildings.    
생각보다 괜찮았다.  


* Delaware State Capitol (Dover)

<img src="https://github.com/hyoo14/hyoo14.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/capitols/dover_outside.jpg?raw=true"  width="100" />

It was built in the great depression.  
대공황때 지었다고 한다.  





* Maryland State Capitol (Annapolis)

<img src="https://github.com/hyoo14/hyoo14.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/capitols/anapolis_outside.jpg?raw=true"  width="100" />

It is nice with cherry blossom. I can feel the history of Maryland there.  
역사가 있는 꽤 좋음.  



* U.S. Capitol (Washington D.C.)

<img src="https://github.com/hyoo14/hyoo14.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/capitols/dc_outside.jpg?raw=true"  width="100" />

National Capital.  
수도는 역시 수도  



* South Carolina State Capitol (Columbia)

<img src="https://github.com/hyoo14/hyoo14.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/capitols/columbia_outside.jpg?raw=true"  width="100" />

Pretty big with nice palm trees.  
꽤 크고 야자수가 인상적.  


* Texas State Capitol (Austin)

<img src="https://github.com/hyoo14/hyoo14.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/capitols/austin_outside.jpg?raw=true"  width="100" />

It is a massive structure, but inside is not impressive.  
많이 큰데 내부가 소박.
