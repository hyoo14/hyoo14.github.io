Some people think that it is best to watch movies that teach us about the real world.  
However, in my opinion, films that do not include real-life lessons are just as good.  
These types of movies are an excellent means of reducing stress, and even movies that  
teach about real life can misinform viewers.  


To begin with, viewing movies that are not based on real-life problems is a great way  
to relieve stress.  
People have a variety of factors in their lives that cause them to worry, such as school,  
jobs, and personal relationships.  
These types of movies help us forget about these real-life issues.  
For instance, I recently felt a lot of stress when I was studying for my final exams.  
Even during times when I was not actually studying, I found myself worrying about the tests  
and I was unable to completely relax.  
I decided to take a study break one night and watch one of my favorite fantasy movies,  
The Chronicles of Narnia.  
For almost three hours, I completely forgot about the exam and lost myself in the movie.  
When the film was finished, I felt a lot better.  


On top of that, even films that are supposed to teach us something about the real world  
can be misleading.  
In fact, movies based on real events are still fictional and dramatic.  
This means that their portrayals of real-world people and events are often inaccurate,  
so audiences can end up with false impressions.  
For example, a study by the Islamic Human Rights Commission found that movies often  
portray Muslims as violent and dangerous, which encourages negative stereotypes about tem.  
This can lead to anti-Islamic sentiment in society.  
The study found that inaccurate portrayals of Islam in films actually cause many people to have  
bad opinions of Muslims.  
As this shows, films often contain false representations of people, which may have negative  
effects on our understanding of the world and our treatment of others.  


To sum up, movies that are not based on real life can lower our stress levels, and even films  
that purport to instruct viewers about reality can actually give rise to misconceptions.  
In this regard, I argue that films that teach us about real life are not the best ones.
