I agree with the statement that cell phones should not be allowed in schools.   
First, cell phones can disturb classes.   
For example, if someone's phone rings, it could interrupt the teacher.  


Second, cell phones can be distracting.   
To be specific, students can be distracted by sending and receiving text messages. (This could also distract others nearby.)   


For these reason, I believe students shouldn't use their cell phones in school.

According to the reading, a theater professor has given his students an assignment to attend a play and write a review.   
The woman doesn't think it is a good ides for two reason.   


First, she says that the deadline is too soon.   
This is because the students are performing in a play next month and they are still practicing, so they don't have time to watch a play and write a review on top of that.  


Second, she mentions that the discount on tickets is too small.   
This is because they already spend money on books and supplies, so it's burdensome for the students to buy tickets.   


For these reasons, she thinks it is not a good idea.

According to the reading, the peak-end rule is how people judge and overall experience based on its peak and end.   
The professor uses a personal experience to explain the peak-end rule.  


First, she describes her stay at a five star hotel.   
She was welcomed and was impressed with everything. However, at the hotel restaurant, she was disappointed because the steak tasted horrible.  


Then, she describes how she called the front desk for assistance, but nobody answered. So she struggled down to the lobby to check out and waited for an hour. As a result, even though her first impression of the hotel were positive, she remembered the total experience as bad.   


These examples demonstrate the peak-end rule.

The professor explains how aquatic insects survive underwater by giving two examples.  


First, he describes physical gills, which extract oxygen from the water. He uses the example of a mayfly larva. It moves its gills back and forth to increase the oxygen it receives.   


Second, he describes high levels of hemoglobin.  
Hemoglobin is a substance in the blood that helps transport  oxygen to cells. He mentions the example of a bloodworm. It has high levels of hemoglobin, so it can store a backup supply of oxygen.  


These examples demonstrate how aquatic insects survive underwater.
