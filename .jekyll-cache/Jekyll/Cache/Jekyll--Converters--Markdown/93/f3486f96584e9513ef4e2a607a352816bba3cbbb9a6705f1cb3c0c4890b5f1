<p>I agree with the statement that cell phones should not be allowed in schools. <br />
First, cell phones can disturb classes. <br />
For example, if someone’s phone rings, it could interrupt the teacher.</p>

<p>Second, cell phones can be distracting. <br />
To be specific, students can be distracted by sending and receiving text messages. (This could also distract others nearby.)</p>

<p>For these reason, I believe students shouldn’t use their cell phones in school.</p>

<p>According to the reading, a theater professor has given his students an assignment to attend a play and write a review. <br />
The woman doesn’t think it is a good ides for two reason.</p>

<p>First, she says that the deadline is too soon. <br />
This is because the students are performing in a play next month and they are still practicing, so they don’t have time to watch a play and write a review on top of that.</p>

<p>Second, she mentions that the discount on tickets is too small. <br />
This is because they already spend money on books and supplies, so it’s burdensome for the students to buy tickets.</p>

<p>For these reasons, she thinks it is not a good idea.</p>

<hr />

<p>According to the reading, the peak-end rule is how people judge and overall experience based on its peak and end. <br />
The professor uses a personal experience to explain the peak-end rule.</p>

<p>First, she describes her stay at a five star hotel. <br />
She was welcomed and was impressed with everything. However, at the hotel restaurant, she was disappointed because the steak tasted horrible.</p>

<p>Then, she describes how she called the front desk for assistance, but nobody answered. So she struggled down to the lobby to check out and waited for an hour. As a result, even though her first impression of the hotel were positive, she remembered the total experience as bad.</p>

<p>These examples demonstrate the peak-end rule.</p>

<hr />

<p>The professor explains how aquatic insects survive underwater by giving two examples.</p>

<p>First, he describes physical gills, which extract oxygen from the water. He uses the example of a mayfly larva. It moves its gills back and forth to increase the oxygen it receives.</p>

<p>Second, he describes high levels of hemoglobin.<br />
Hemoglobin is a substance in the blood that helps transport  oxygen to cells. He mentions the example of a bloodworm. It has high levels of hemoglobin, so it can store a backup supply of oxygen.</p>

<p>These examples demonstrate how aquatic insects survive underwater.</p>

<p>I agree with the statement that elementary school teachers should encourage their students to use computers.</p>

<p>First, computers are good learning tools for students. <br />
To be specific, there are interesting materials available to learners these days. <br />
<del>They can easily access these useful resources with computers.</del></p>

<p>Second, the ability to use a computer is an essential life skill. <br />
For example, <del>communications now frequently occur through computers.</del> <br />
<del>Consequently,</del> students will need to use computers in school and work thrughout their lives.</p>

<p>For these reasons, I think elementary school teachers should help students learn to use computers.</p>

<hr />

<p>According to the reading, a student wrote a letter to the school newspaper suggesting that the library change its policy on lending out art books. <br />
The man does not think it is a good idea for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, he says that shortening the lending period is unrealistic. This is because students need more than one week to finish assignments. It takes a long time to read, take notes, and double-check things.</p>

<p>Second, he mentions that leaving ID cards is not practical. This is because students need their cards for other purposes, such as for accessing study roms and dining halls.</p>

<p>For these reasons, he believes it is not a great idea.</p>

<hr />

<p>According to the reading, restoration ecology is the practice of actively restoring damaged ecosystems.<br />
The professor uses two examples to explain restoration ecology.</p>

<p>First, he describes how cover crops are planted to prevent erosion.<br />
Quickly growing annual grasses fix themselves into the soil and prevent it from eroding.<br />
Cover crops also slow raindrops before they hit the ground and loosen the soil.</p>

<p>Second, he describes how controlled prairie fires are used to restore native plants.<br />
The fires burn away dead plants and invasive species which compete with native plants for light and resources.<br />
The fires also darken the earth, so it absorbs more sunlight and helps plants grow.</p>

<p>These examples demonstrate restoration ecology.</p>

<hr />

<p>The professor describes the benefits of flooding to ancient farmers by giving two examples.</p>

<p>First, she describes how flooding provided a water resource.<br />
In desert climates, people had to find ways to use floodwater to farm.<br />
For instance, Mesopotamian farmer built canals from the rivers, which bought water to their fields, and they made dams to store water.</p>

<p>Second, she describes how flooding made the land rich.<br />
When rivers flood, mud containing nutrients washes into field and enriches the soil.<br />
For example, the soil of Egypt was poor in nutrients, but when the Nile flooded, rich mud was carried onto shore, and it made growing lots of crops possible.</p>

<p>These examples demonstrate two ways flooding benefited ancient farmers.</p>

<p>I believe that television has a negative influence on people.</p>

<p>First of all, there are too many violent programs on televisions.<br />
Watching thousands of images of killing is not good for people.<br />
These increase people’s aggression and anger.<br />
The number of crimes in our society is related to all the violence that television feeds people.</p>

<p>Moreover, television is mindless entertainment.<br />
Most programs do not serve any educational purpose and encourage passiveness.<br />
As a result, people become less active.<br />
Some would even argue they become unquestioning robots.</p>

<hr />

<p>According to the reading, the university has changed the dormitory visitation policy, allowing visitors to stay in a resident’s room only until 11 p.m. on weekdays.<br />
The woman thinks it is a good idea for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, she says that when visitors stay late, some residents find it difficult to get enough sleep.<br />
They can get only 5 hours sleep with the old policy, but 7 hours with the new policy.</p>

<p>Second, she mentions that many visitors sleep over without permission when they stay late.<br />
This makes dorm residents feel uncomfortable and feel like their privacy is violated.</p>

<hr />

<p>According to the reading, the halo effect is a cognitive bias wherein the evaluation of a specific attribute affects unrelated traits.<br />
The professor describes two examples to explain the halo effect.</p>

<p>First, he describes the connection between beauty and perceived intelligence.<br />
In a study, participants were asked to read a paragraph and then shown different photos of the supposed author.<br />
Half of them were shown a photo of an attractive person and half were shown a photo of an unattractive person.<br />
When they were asked to rate the paragraph, the participants who were shown the more attractive photo gave higher scores.</p>

<p>Second, he describes the connection between attractiveness and sentencing outcomes in criminal trials.<br />
Photos of defendants in the cases were rated on attractiveness, and then the ratings were compared with the outcomes of the cases.<br />
Attractive people received shorter sentences.</p>

<hr />

<p>The professor explains how animals in the Arctic have evolved by giving two examples.</p>

<p>First, she describes the reindeer, which has developed long legs.<br />
The animal’s long legs keep its body above the ground, which helps it maintain its temperature.<br />
In addition, the animal’s legs feature hooves with a sharp rim so they can slice through snow and dig into ice.</p>

<p>Second, she describes the sea lion, which has a layer of fat called blubber underneath their skin.<br />
The blubber provides a barrier between the internal organs of the animal and the cold water.<br />
Moreover, the animal’s blood vessels don’t travel to the outer parts of its body, and this prevents heat loss.</p>

<p>I prefer to borrow books rather than to buy them.</p>

<p>First, It is possible to save a lot of money by borrowing books.<br />
For example, I used to spend over a hundred dollars each month buying books.<br />
Now that I borrow them, I do not have to spend this money.</p>

<p>Second, borrowing books is a great way to discover new authors.<br />
To be specific, I usually buy books written by the same authors.<br />
But when I go to the library, I have the opportunity to try reading books by other authors without having to buy them.</p>

<hr />

<p>According to the reading, a student thinks that the university students need a new parking lot even though there’s already one on campus.<br />
The man does not think it is a good idea for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, he says that the university will have to spend money for a parking facility.<br />
The university will increase tuition fees to pay for the parking lot.</p>

<p>Second, he mentions that students go to the cafe to have drinks or to study.<br />
They would dislike staying at the cafe with all the exhaust and noise coming from the cars.</p>

<hr />

<p>According to the reading, climate adaptation is how animals respond to climatic conditions in their habitats to ensure survival.<br />
The professor describes two examples to explain climate adaptation.</p>

<p>First, she describes polar bears.<br />
Found in the Arctic Circle where the weather is ver cold, the large body of a polar bear is an adaptation to its habitat.<br />
Because larger animals lose less body heat, polar bears can stay warm and survive the cold weather.</p>

<p>Second, she describes spectacled bears.<br />
Spectacled bears live in warmer areas of South America and have a relatively small body size.<br />
This allows them to radiate more heat through the skin and keep their body temperatures low, making them well-suited to a mild climate.</p>

<hr />

<p>The professor explains negative effects of advertising by giving two examples.</p>

<p>First, he describes the way advertising encourages excessive consumption.<br />
For example, cell phones are overly marketed.<br />
Advertising creates a continuous cycle of demand, so customers trade in for the newest model even though their phones function well.</p>

<p>Second, he describes the negative effect advertising has on body image.<br />
For example, a narrow range of appearances and body types is portrayed in ads for fashion and beauty products, so viewers naturally adjust their personal beauty standards based on these.<br />
However, since many people can’t measure up to the standard of beauty in the ads, they may develop low self-esteem.</p>
